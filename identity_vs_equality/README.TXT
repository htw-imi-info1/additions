------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project contains two exercises to distinguish
object identity and object equality.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

look at the static methods in Exercises to see the created objects,
and try to determine which pairs are == and equals() - you 
can print out an empty table using the printEmpty method in TablePrinter:

TablePrinter.printEmpty("a",5);

which prints

    a1  a2  a3  a4  a5
 a1  /   /   /   /   / 
 a2  /   /   /   /   / 
 a3  /   /   /   /   / 
 a4  /   /   /   /   / 
 a5  /   /   /   /   / 
 
- read the source code in 

Exercises.classExercise();

 and fill out the table above like we did in class.

Exercises.newExercise(); contains a similar, but slightly different exercise:

TablePrinter.printEmpty("b",5);

    b1  b2  b3  b4  b5
 b1  /   /   /   /   / 
 b2  /   /   /   /   / 
 b3  /   /   /   /   / 
 b4  /   /   /   /   / 
 b5  /   /   /   /   / 
 
 There is are also all details about String equality in StringEquality.
